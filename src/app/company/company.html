			<div class="fade-in-up-item ct">We are a San Francisco-based startup who believe that everything should be connected. Mainstream connected-home technology wasn’t doing enough. Our thermostat, door, and even toaster (don’t ask) are connected in the Internet of Things, but what we really want is seamless access to our media, from any screen and any speaker. And we want it without the lag, disruptions and out-of-synch audio that you get with the current solutions.</div>
